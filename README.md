# Constrained Whole-Body Tracking for Humanoid Robots

Safe whole-body control of the Unitree G1

## Prerequisites

### Python, Ubuntu, and ROS2 Versioning 

These instructions will assume we are using Python 3.12.3, Ubuntu 24.04, and ROS2 Jazzy. Other 3.12.x versions should work with Jazzy, but in general, I recommend running `python3` outside of any virtual environments to check what version your system python is, and match that exactly.

The code should also work for Ubuntu 22.04/ROS2 Humble/Python 3.10.x, but you'll need to tweak things to make this work. For starters, you'll need to (at least) replace any instances of `jazzy` with `humble`.

### Fetching the code

```
git clone https://github.com/StanfordASL/constrainedmimic
cd constrainedmimic
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
We also need to pull in some dependencies for `unitree_ros2`, following their own [instructions](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2/blob/668d1ec5a05d1c38d3306bdca7d59f2ba3581a88/README.md?plain=1#L63-L68):
```
cd cm_ws/src/third_party/unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds -b jazzy
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds -b releases/0.10.x 
```

### Virtual environment

We use `uv` to manage the virtual environment. If you don't have `uv` already installed, run the following:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Optional, but recommended:
# echo 'eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then, in the top-level `constrainedmimic` directory,
```
uv venv --python 3.12.3 --system-site-packages
source .venv/bin/activate
cd cm_control
uv pip install -e .
```

### MuJoCo

For some ROS2 nodes, I use the C++ interface for MuJoCo. This requires building from source. First, navigate back to wherever you prefer to install MuJoCo and then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco
cd mujoco
git checkout 3.4.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/mujoco -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```
Note that I used version `3.4.0` and decided to install to `/opt/mujoco` -- you can change this as needed. Check out the MuJoCo [building from source documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming/#building-from-source) for more details.


### Pico VR

Download the release deb from [this link](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service/releases) according to your ubuntu version (for instance, `XRoboToolkit_PC_Service_1.0.0_ubuntu_24.04_amd64.deb` for Ubuntu 24.04). Then, install with `sudo dpkg -i XRoboToolkit_PC_Service_1.0.0_ubuntu_24.04_amd64.deb`

#### Usage

In a fresh terminal, run `adb devices` to see if the device is connected. Then, set up reverse port forwarding:
```
adb reverse tcp:63901 tcp:63901
```
And verify the port forward is active:
```
adb reverse --list
```
In the headset app, enter `127.0.0.1` as the IP address for the PC service, if it did not automatically detect it.

Then, open the XRoboToolkit app on the computer. It should say Status: CONNECTED in the Pico now. You should be able to close the app now on the computer, but it is not necessary.


### ROS2 setup

First, make sure that you have ROS2 installed. See the ROS2 Jazzy installation guide [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

Install the required dependencies from `unitree_ros2` to communicate via cyclonedds
```
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rosidl-generator-dds-idl
sudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev
```
And some additional dependencies for this project
```
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-pinocchio
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-vrpn
```

In a fresh shell session (without sourcing `/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash`), navigate back to the top-level workspace (`constrainedmimic/cm_ws`) and run a build:
```
./scripts/build_all.sh
```
Before running the nodes in any new terminals, be sure to source the setup script. If working in sim,
```
source scripts/setup_sim.sh
```
or if working with hardware,
```
source scripts/setup_hardware.sh
```

### SAM 3 (perception)

`g1_perception` segments the RealSense image with [SAM 3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3). It needs an NVIDIA GPU with ~4 GB free and the NVIDIA driver (CUDA 13 capable); the CUDA toolkit is not needed, PyTorch ships its own runtime.

Clone SAM 3 next to `constrainedmimic` (not inside it) and install it into the venv. SAM 3 declares `numpy<2`, which would downgrade the numpy JAX needs, so pin numpy with an override; it runs fine on numpy 2. From the top-level `constrainedmimic` directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3 ../sam3
python -c "import numpy; print('numpy==' + numpy.__version__)" > /tmp/numpy_override.txt
uv pip install --override /tmp/numpy_override.txt -e ../sam3 torch torchvision einops pycocotools pyzmq "setuptools<80"
```
`setuptools<80` matters: torch pulls in a newer setuptools that breaks `colcon build --symlink-install` for Python packages ("option --uninstall not recognized"). Rebuild afterwards with `./scripts/build_all.sh`, which runs colcon from the venv so the nodes use the venv's Python.

The weights are gated: request access on [huggingface.co/facebook/sam3](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3), then log in once with `hf auth login`. The first start downloads ~3.5 GB.

Usage (with `realsense_server.py` running on PC2):
```
ros2 launch g1_perception realsense_bridge.launch.py
ros2 service call /g1_perception/capture_scene g1_control_msgs/srv/CaptureScene "{prompts: ['table', 'box']}"
```
The service returns the labels and scores; the frame and masks are published on `/g1_perception/snapshot/*` and the overlay is shown in RViz. Launch with `sam3:=false` for the camera stream only.
